<h1>About Our Team</h1>
<span class="writeup">
<p>The Boys' and Girls' Cross Country programs are among long list of successful sports programs at QND.  Since its inception in 2000, the Girls' program has qualified either teams or individuals for Sectionals each year and has produced All-Sectional and All-State runners in eight out of twelve seasons. Since its inception in 2001, the Boys' program has qualified individuals or teams for the Sectional meet each year. In 2010 the team earned it's first trip to State and finished 18th! In 2011 the team had it's first male qualify as an individual for the State Meet!</p>
<p>QND Cross Country success begins with commitment to a guiding principle: Gentleman or Lady first; Scholar second; Athlete third. Anything less is unacceptable.</p>

<p>Academics play an important role in a student's life. Our Cross Country athletes take this role to heart. The boys team achieved a 3.48 total cumulative team grade point average during the 2011-12 season, earning them the IHSA Team Academic Achievement Award! Likewise, the girls team achieved a 3.78 total cumulative team grade point average during the 2009-10 season, earning them the IHSA Team Academic Achievement Award! This marks the sixth straight year both teams have earned this honor!  Coach Terwelp and I are very proud of each student-athlete who believed in and exemplified our team's guiding principles.</p>

<p>Unlike most sports, both teams practice together and attend the same meets. Cross Country races are typically three miles in length and are contested in parks, on golf courses and occasionally pass through farm pastures and creeks. While team success is important, individual runners benchmark their success against personal-best times or finishes. These personal successes help build/enhance self-confidence, self-esteem and self-discipline that carry throughout the individual's life. These improvements automatically enhance team success and the value of teamwork. All runners compete in all meets during the regular season as members of either the JV or Varsity squads.</p>

<p>Captain's Practices begin in mid to late May and official team practices start in mid-August. For the seventh year in a row the team held a pre-season team-building experience. This year the team spent four days and three nights in Southern Illinois participating in a low-ropes/high-ropes teams challenge course, rock climbing, rappelling, canoeing, swimming and, of course, enjoying daily trail runs through the Shawnee National Forest. Last season the team travelled to the Eleven Points River in southern Missouri for a four day, three night canoeing trip and if all goes as planned the team will return to the Eleven Points River in 2013. To commemorate their experience on these trips, the team designs a special shirt featuring high points of the trip. The regular season begins the last week of August and concludes the second week in November.</p>


<p>If you are a new or returning student to QND, Coaches Edgar and Terwelp encourage you to contact one of us to learn more about the sport of Cross Country. Cross Country is an excellent sport for athletes of all abilities. There is no bench and there are no cuts. Everyone competes in every meet and both squads practice and race at the same locations. The sport is pure in that each person's efforts are rewarded in terms of a personal best time, the defeat of an individual you've never beaten before (regardless of whether or not you are the fastest person on the team), and personal self-esteem and confidence are greatly enhanced. Too often these elements are ignored or de-emphasized in sports. With Quincy Notre Dame Cross Country these elements are focal.</p>

<p>Thank you to all of our coaches, parents, sponsors, administrators and fans who made cross country season special. We're already looking forward to, and planning for, the upcoming season in 2014!</p>

<p>Coach Edgar</p>
